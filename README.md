# MOPR/D repository

This repository contains supplementary results for seven multi-objective path-relinking variants from the literature (PRr, PRpr, PRpo, PRoc, PRpc, PRac, PRic) and a Decomposition-based Multi-objective Path-relinking (MOPR/D). The results concern the 0/1 Multi-objective Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MoMKP), the Multi-objective Quadratic Assignment Problem (MoQAP), and the Multiobjective Spanning Tree Problem (MoSTP). The benchmark instances are available as well.   

This material is our original work and has been published in Computers & Operations Research.
